# Advanced React

Building components is pretty straightforward, but we can't do much if all we can do is spit out static HTML. We want our app to have rich behavior, driven by stateful components and complex interactions.

We do this in React by means of the *Lifecycle Methods* and *the state*. You can think of React as one big state machine, stepping through each state change, and at each step, a lifecycle method handles that particular state. This is the core method by which React's one-way data flow emerges.

In the coming exercises we will learn how React manages state.

## Exercise
* Enable the button on the App main page to change the image in the image rotator component.
* Add a filter so that the image from the 'sports' category is not rendered.
