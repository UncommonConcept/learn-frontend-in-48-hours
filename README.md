# Implement Redux in the Reddit app

In the previous exercises we saw how to install, configure, and use `Redux`, `Jumpstate`, and `react-redux`. We walked through enough examples that we are now ready to begin integrating this into our app.

We need to be able to do the following with Redux and Jumpstate:

1. Trigger the API requests that will allow us to download data from our Reddit API.
2. Store the results of those requests into our store
3. Provide the data to our React components to display data
4. When the data changes (for example we navigate to a different page), the displayed data should change too

We will work on this the rest of the afternoon together.
